HTML looked like Chinese text to me, I was scared of coding; now I rock Six Programming Languages, build efficient solutions to business problems everyday.

- Java
- JS
- Python
- PHP
- C/C++
- HTML/CSS?? ðŸ¤”

(I know HTML is not a programming language, I am still looking for that 6th one, any suggestions?)

**What I built for work lately:**

A python script that can categorieze 150K company names in 20 seconds. Saving a month of manual work. 

**What I built for fun lately:**

The Periodic Table of Elements with ReactJS, so that I can memorize them.
